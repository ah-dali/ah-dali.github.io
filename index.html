	<h1>Music might make you happy, but how happy is the music?</h1>
	<h2 id="intro">Music as numbers</h2>
	<p>There's more to the music we listen to everyday. It's not just instruments, voices, and beats – it's also numbers.  

If you're a Spotify user, you've come across the numerous playlists made available for you – some of which even customised specifically based on your taste. This is done with, as one would guess, algorithms which use the different audio features to organise the tracks.  

Spotify has quantifiable data on several audio features including tempo, energy, danceability, and valency. While the first three are pretty self-explanatory, the one we're interested in is valency. This is a measure of how negative or positive a song is, and it's the key part of today's story. </p>
	<br></br>
	<h2 id="today">Today's Tunes</h2>
	<p>Some artists (I.e. Sam Smith, Lana Del Rey, The Weeknd) are known for their generally sadder music that gets you 'right in the feels' as the kids say. Other artists (I.e Katy Perry, Bruno Mars, Pharrell Williams) are known for usually happier vibes. But overall, how sad or happy is today's music? 

Valence figures look at how 'negative' or 'positive' a track is. The lower the number, the more negative it is. As with all things in life, it's not 100% foolproof, but it is a decent enough indicator to explore.  

I looked at 31 of today's popular artists, most of whom currently hold songs on the top charts. Out of the 31, only 7 have a higher percentage of happy or positive music. That's less than a quarter. </p>

	<h2 id="old">The Good Old Days</h2>
	<p>Have popular artists always been producing generally sad music? The numbers show that no, they have not. Looking at 18 of the top artists from the 60s till the 90s, only 3 had more sad or negative music. The rest were generally more cheerful than they were sad. </p>
	<br></br>
	<h2 id="shift">What went wrong?</h2>
	<p>Worried that my sample size was giving me skewed results, I turned to the wonderful world of academia for some validation. A 2012 study by E Glenn Shellenberg and Christian Scheve looked at the top 40 charts in America over five decades. It analysed the tempo and mode (major (tends to be happier)/minor (tends to be slower or sadder)) of over 1000 recordings and concluded that "there was an increase in the use of minor mode and a decrease in average tempo, confirming that popular music became more sad-sounding over time." 

Today, six years after the study, this conclusion still holds true.  </p>

	<h1>Music might make you happy, but how happy is the music?</h1>
	<h2 id="intro">Music as numbers</h2>
	<p>Spotify has quantifiable data on several variables including tempo, energy, danceability, and valency. While the first three are pretty self-explanatory, the one we're interested in is valency. This is a measure of how negative or positive a song is, and it's the key part of today's story. </a></p>
	<h2 id="today">Today's Tunes</h2>
	<p>Some artists (I.e. Sam Smith, Lana Del Rey, The Weeknd) are known for their generally sadder music that gets you 'in the feels' as the kids say. Other artists (I.e Katy Perry, Bruno Mars, Pharrell Williams) are known for usually happier vibes. But overall, how sad or happy is today's music? </a></p>

	<h2 id="old">The Good Old Days</h2>
	<p>Have popular artists always been producing sadder music? The numbers show that no, they have not. Looking at 18 of the top artists from the 60s till the 90s, only 3 had more sad or negative music. The rest were generally more cheerful than they were sad.</a></p>
	<h2 id="shift">To the left, to the left</h2>
	<p>A 2012 study looked at the top 40 charts in America over five decades. It analysed the tempo and mode (major/minor) of over 1000 recordings and concluded that "there was an increase in the use of minor mode and a decrease in average tempo, confirming that popular music became more sad-sounding over time." Today, six years after the study, this conclusion still holds true.</a></p>
